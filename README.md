# Lab | BMI in Denmark

## Introduction

This lab investigates overweight and obesity in Denmark, focusing on the Body Mass Index (BMI) as a key measure. Overweight and obesity are growing concerns in many Western countries, including Denmark, and are linked to health issues such as hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. These conditions have significant economic implications due to rising healthcare costs. As a result, understanding the distribution of BMI in the Danish population and the factors that influence it is crucial for public health policy and industry stakeholders.

## Objectives
- Analyze BMI data from a Danish survey.
- Explore the relationship between BMI and variables such as gender, age, education, and fast food consumption.
- Assess whether there is an association between BMI and the frequency of fast food intake.
- Discuss the role of public awareness and policy, such as calorie labeling in fast food restaurants.


## BMI Definition and Classification

BMI (Body Mass Index) is calculated as follows:

$$\text{BMI} = \frac{\text{weight (kg)}}{[\text{height (m)}]^2}$$

BMI categories, based on WHO standards:

| BMI Score         | Assessment                                   |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Less than 18.5    | Underweight                                  |
| 18.5 – 24.9       | Normal weight                                |
| 25 – 29.9         | Moderately overweight                        |
| 30 – 34.9         | Severely overweight (Obesity Class I)        |
| 35 – 39.9         | Severely overweight (Obesity Class II)       |
| 40 and above      | Extremely severe obesity (Obesity Class III) |

## Dataset Description

The dataset (`bmi1_data.csv`) contains survey responses from individuals in Denmark.

The following variables are included:

- **gender**: Respondent’s gender (0 = Female, 1 = Male)
- **height**: Height in centimeters
- **weight**: Weight in kilograms
- **urbanity**: Size of the city/town where the respondent lives
- **fastfood**: Number of days per year the respondent eats fast food


## Getting Started

Open the `Descriptive_Analysis_BMI.ipynb` file in the `your-code` directory. Remeber to first Review the dataset and variable descriptions. Use the provided Jupyter notebook as a starting point for your analysis.

Please keep in mind that you might also need to use some of the functions you saw in the previous lessons. 

## Deliverables

- `Descriptive_Analysis_BMI.ipynb` with your responses.

## Submission

Upon completion, add your deliverables to git. Then commit git and push your branch to the remote.
